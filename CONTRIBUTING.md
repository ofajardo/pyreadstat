- For quick corrections on documentation or code, just submit a pull request!

- For larger contributions to new features or changing existing ones, please file an issue first to get aligned before you start investing time on it.
  Pull requests in this case should be submitted to the dev branch.
  
- We will admit contributions against the python (or cython) code and documentation only. For changes to the underlying C library Readstat 
(anything under the folder src), please submit a pull request to Readstat first, we will not do any change directly in pyreadstat!. Again, 
please submit an issue to discuss your proposed changes before starting investing time on it.
