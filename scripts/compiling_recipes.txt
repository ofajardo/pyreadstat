# Recipes to be run manually in the shell/command window

python3 setup.py install --user


# compile in place (needed to build the documentation)

python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

# compile in place rebuilding c sources

python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace --use-cython
* Note: if cython is installed it will be used anyway. The resulting .c files will be different depending if built on
windows or linux. That means to generate wheels for windows, make sure that pyx are cythonized on windows.
